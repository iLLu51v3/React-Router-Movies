/**  #### Refactor so that our code is DRY
 *  [ ] You may notice that we are using very similar JSX in the `Movie` component and in the `MovieDetails` component in `MovieList.js`. The main difference is the list of stars, which only exists in the "detailed" view of the `Movie` component.
 *  [ ] Create a new component in `MovieCard.js` that returns a Movie Card. Then remove the old code from `Movie` and `MovieDetails` and instead return the new `MovieCard` component.
 * [ ] The Movie Card should be flexible enough to handle displaying a movie with or without the list of stars.
